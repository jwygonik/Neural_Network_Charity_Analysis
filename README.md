# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
Using Python TensorFlow Library to create a robust deep learning neural network capable of helping our client decide which organizations should receive donations. I chose to run modules in Google Colab due to issues with getting TensorFlow to work properly on my computer. This ultimately caused some issues completing all the deliverables. I was successful in building and running my initial model but fell short when optimizing an saving to the h5 format. 

## Results

	* Data Preprocessing: 
	
		* Target Variable: 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column from charity.csv
		
		* Features: All the remaining columns except from the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' target variable

		* EIN and NAME columns were neither targets or features and therefore dropped from the model early on
